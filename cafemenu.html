		<h1>Promotions</h1>
		<article>
			<h2>We love cupons, just like you!</h2>

			<p class="p-coupon">Because we really want you to come and taste our delicious coffee, we want to give our customers free coupons from time to time. In them you will find discounts, promotions and even free products. We also have special coupons for frequent customers, but you will only find them once you visit our store. Please, ask for them, these have double the rewards!</p>

			<h2>Merchandise for sale!</h2>
			<p class="p-merchandise">To make matters worse, we have a mini shop at the counter where you can buy other things besides books, such as clothing with book prints, containers and brand glasses, reading tools, among many others. We do not have online sales, so be sure to take a little reminder if you are just passing through. We want to extend this section more, but that will totally depend on our clients. If you wish, we will do it with pleasure.</p>
