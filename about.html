			<p>The first Books and Mortar opened on Wealthy Street in <a href="http://www.rapidgrowthmedia.com/features/neighborhoodsofgreastown.aspx">Grand Rapids' Eastown neighborhood</a> in the early 1960's. It was a small, downtrodden, literary bookstore with creaky floors and dust covering everythingyou could see. We had a mechanical cash register, pen and paper, and a staff that knew every book in the store by heart. The retail book industry has changed dramatically over the decades, but we discovered that Books and Mortar could coexist with the huge national chains and thrive by finding unique locations and creating personal, full-service stores where you don't expect to find them.</p>

			<p>Like vinyl, casettes, and classic cars, books are back in style. Like those other tiems, we have learned how to keep up with the times. We have a cafe. We learned how to dust. Want to browse for a while, have a cup of coffee, come back tomorrow? Fine with us! Want to see you own book on our shelves? Can do! Want to see your favorite writers and have your heart stolen by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/31/fresh-voices-50-writers-you-should-read-now">new ones you haven't heard of?</a> We have public readings all the time. Come check out the store sometime, we think you'd like it.</p>
