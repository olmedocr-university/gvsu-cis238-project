		<h1>Books, books, and more books!</h1>

			<h2>What to expect when you walk in:</h2>
				
			<p class="p-books">Welcome, to the wonderful world of literature! As a Brick and Mortar book store, we endeavor to bring you as many books as we possibly can, in as physical a form as we can manage. We have an in-store collection of over 23,000 books, in any and every genre you could imagine, from cook books to science fiction!
			<br> <br>In addition to our paperback and hard covers, we also have a multitude of kindle tablets available in the store for your use, with access to thousands more books online that are open to your perusal. We specialize in books, and as such we want to expose you to as much of the literary world as we possibly can. Please, come on in and read for a while!</p>

			<h2>How did we acquire our collection?</h2>

			<p class="p-books2">Many of our books are acquisitions from mainstream printing companies such as:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li class="p-books2">Quebecor World</li>
				<li class="p-books2">Banta Corporation</li>
				<li class="p-books2">Von Hoffmann</li>
				<li class="p-books2">Transcontinental Printing</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="p-books2">Some writers have specifically come to us to have their books published and printed, which is a service we can provide upon request, in which case we usually go through Chronicle or Sourcebooks Publishing companies, and from there it is sent to any of the book manufacturing companies listed above. This is a less frequently occurring situation, but is always a special experience for us as a store, to witness the birth of a writer!
			
			<br> <br> Our last method is purchases from other book stores. The literary community is all about the spread of information and literacy, and as such it is common practice to make extra wares available to other stores for purchase. We purchase from anyone who is willing to share what they have in stock, whatever it may be, all for the betterment of our readers and customers!</p>
